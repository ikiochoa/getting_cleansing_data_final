# Project Codebook
This codebook describes the variables, data and transformations performed to clean up the data. 

## Variables
### Measurements
* `tBodyAccMeanX`

### Identifiers
* `subjects`: Nr of person that performed the experiment
* `activity`: One of the six performed activities, with the following labels:
** 1 - WALKING
** 2 - WALKING_UPSTAIRS
** 3 - WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
** 4 - SITTING
** 5 - STANDING
** 6 - LAYING

## Data
Used the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset" Version 1.0 available under https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## Transformations
1. Merges training and test sets to create one dataset.
 `train/X_train.txt`: Training set. and `test/X_test.txt`: Test set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation from mergedData.
 Keeping only variables with "-mean()" or "-st()" inside the name.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 `activity_labels.txt` is cbind with mergedData and activity numbers mutated into the labels
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  Cleans variable names from symbols like - ()
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
